				<h1>Food for Thought:</h1>
				
				<p>This realm of reality is quite comical don't you think? You, me, and everyone you know desire something, or someone. We spend every waking hour of our day enslaved to our desires, sacrificing our time and health for it. As time goes on, our skin sags, our eyes grow blurry and we've attained our desires but now we've run out of time and depleted our health. At this point in life, can you use what you've accomplished with your desire to regain your life and health?   </p>
