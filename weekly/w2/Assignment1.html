	<h1>Web Site Critique</h1>
	<h2>The Bad</h2>

	<p>This website does not use a grid. There are no navigational structure and has bad typography that makes it seem very cluttered and unreadable. There are random uses of color and its very messy, reducing the appeal of the website. It looks like a magazine add. There is also no form and it does not flow together.</p>

	<p>The main problem of this design is the lack of contrast. I don’t know where to click. I think contrast helps the user to know where the core info of the page is. It also helps the user to better read and understand said info. The background color and text color are practically the same. Lastly, the fonts are too small.</p>
	
	<h2>The Good</h2>
	<img src="img/Googless.png" alt="Screen of Google homepage" width="50%">
	<p><a href="https://www.google.com/"> google homepage</a></p>
	<p>No one ever has problems with the design of google. Everything is clean and lined up. It is very neat and clutter-free and has just the right font sizes and spaces in between each different website choices. The grouping of the tabs also makes sense. It’s also very intuitive because when I type in a word, it automatically defines said word without me actually typing in “define”, this is just one example.</p><br>
	
	<img src="img/Youtubess.png" alt="Screen of Youtube homepage" width="50%">
	<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> youtube homepage</a></p>
	<p>Youtube also caters to it’s audience. They know that people use their website to stream videos and music so they made the previews big enough so their users can see better. The left collumn is systematically ordered in a way where everything is lined up and easy to access. Like google, they leave sufficent spaces in between each items so it does not seem cluttered. Like nature, everything should flow together.</p><br>
