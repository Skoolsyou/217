	<p> 1.	Rachel Semenov’s webpage starts off with just a picture but as soon as I clicked on a tab, I was amazed at how the pictures showed up as you scroll down. It’s very well organized and there’s a nice contrast in the color schemes. And For the contact, Its cool how she has a “say hi” button instead of the regular boring stuff. <a href="imgcritique/1.png">Rachel's Website</a> </p>
	<p> 2.	Khoi Phan’s webpage looks clean with a main focus on pictures and images but its very professional. It gives such a good vibe especially when I visit his photography section. <a href="imgcritique/2.png">Khoi's Website</a> </p> 
	<p> 3.	Nintendo’s website of Zelda: Breathe of the wild has an awesome theme that is the same as the game. There’s images with a small description under the picture and if you click on the image it takes you to another page. There’s a feature tab that shows what’s to come when you buy the game to entice viewers. The color scheme is well balanced and not overwhelming. <a href="imgcritique/3.png">Zelda's Website</a> </p>
	<p> 4.	Nicholas Brown’s page has great contrast and there’s a video that plays. Videos are good. The layout is smooth and slick. The bg looks professional. Everything is lined up.<a href="imgcritique/4.png">Nicholas Website</a>  </p>
	<p> 5.	The Super Smash Brothers Ultimate website looks like it took so much time to make. There are so much information but it’s still ordered and lined up. Everything looks great. When you click onto a character, the character becomes big and then there’s videos that come up showing the gameplay of said character. <a href="imgcritique/5.png">Nitendo's Website</a> </p>
